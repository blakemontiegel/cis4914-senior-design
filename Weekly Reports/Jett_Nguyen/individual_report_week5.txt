1. From 2/6 to 2/13, I have spent around 6 hours total on this project. This time included solidifying the pull request merge, ensuring the backend was properly integrated into the frontend, and designing Presentation 1. My schedule was dependent on the free time I had from other courses, and the commitment shows through the project’s progress.
2. As mentioned above, the pull request is finalized, and the presentation turned out exactly as envisioned. I collected some more data for the presentation as well to ensure we are fitting the target audience.
3. Through my education, presentations have been fun to make, and this time it was a bit more fun than other times because my workflow has optimized over the years, and the production quality only gets better as public speaking does. Acknowledging from previous learning that presentations are meant as a visual aid, as opposed to a script, helps convey the message even more effectively. 
4. The lesson learned from this week is to stay consistent and not break the flow of work. Even though I did not have a lot to do this week, considering the frontend has been made with no additional merges yet, I found some tasks to do to keep me busy and up to date. Communicating with teammates has been vital in this project, and it only helps me be more prepared for the industry.
