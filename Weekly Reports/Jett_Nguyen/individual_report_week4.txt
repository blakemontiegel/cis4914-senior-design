1.
From 1/31 to 1/6, I have spent around 20 hours total on this project. This represents the time translating
the wireframes to code and resolving conflicts in the pull request. Since some of the backend was implemented
before I was supposed to merge, the conflicts built up. Overall, the project seems to be in good shape and
developing really well.

2. 
As mentioned above, I coded all of the pages and buttons of the app based on the wireframes and wireflow.
Additionally, the pull request was merged successfully after resolving the conflicts. In that process, we
collaborated as a team to go over the conflicts and discuss future plans.

Resolving the PR conflicts was a test of my knowledge in the git workflow. I haven’t worked in pull requests
in a collaborative environment in a long time, so figuring out how to merge the conflicts and close the PR
had to come back to me. I also used practical implementation skills learned in multiple coursed in order to
accurately code the frontend.

All in all, I realized I need to constantly refresh my skills in anything I want to retain. This was
realized through my PR techniques because they were inefficient. This doesn’t apply to just technical skills;
it can just apply to life skills, like how I was good at doing card tricks when I was younger, but now I cannot
remember anything. Skills are retained through repetition and improvement.
