1.
In total, through the dates of 1/15 and 1/23, I have spent around 6 hours of my time to
this project. This includes meeting times, project planning and communication with
teammates. My current project work schedule is built by our team meetings and any extra
time I can find throughout the week to prepare to develop.

In this early stage of development, all of us were only able to contribute to project
planning. My specific contributions to project planning were starting an overview for our
frontend design (colors, pages, general layout), adding Jira tasks to the board,
establishing ground rules, defining workflows, and getting to know the team.

Using information I learned in HCI, I have been well equipped to efficiently and
accurately lay out ideas with user-centered-design/UX in mind. This will especially come
in handy once outlining is done and the ideas can be transferred over to wireframes and
prototypes. Additionally, the collaboration skills I have gained through the various group
projects I have been a part of has shown. I would have never been able to effectively
establish a strong team connection and create a concrete plan this fast a few years ago.
My technical skills will be shown later in development.

As mentioned before, I am enjoying how easy it has been to collaborate as an effect of
getting comfortable with teamwork. Also, I’m just now solidifying my understanding of
the MERN stack because I used it in SWE, but was the Scrum Master and was not as
involved with the planning phase. Getting started with this project is making me realize
that I will be spending a lot more of my time on it than I did this past week. After all, this
is only the beginning. I hope that my previous experiences will prevent me from running
into any problems. I look forward to this final experience at UF!
