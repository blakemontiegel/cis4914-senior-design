Week 6
Name: Frank Malatesta | Group: Trainers
Time Dedicated to the Project
The following is an estimate of the amount of time I spent on each task this week:
* Weekly group meeting: ~30 minutes
* Creating backend structure for video storage in database: ~2 hours 
Staying consistent with our weekly group meetings will keep our team committed and focused towards completing our project.
Contribution to the Project Development Process
I worked on the backend structure for allowing videos to be stored into our database. This was done through the storage of the video URL. I worked on physically storing the videos so they can be queried and their URL returned.
I still have to incorporate the pieces operating in the backend so that the frontend requests can make changes to the database accordingly and upload and receive videos.
Demonstration of Applied Knowledge
I used my knowledge of MongoDB to create an effective structure for our database storage of videos via backend systems.
I continued to research and work into the physical storage of videos and how that can be used in tandem with the work in the backend for video retrieval.
Reflection and Lessons Learned
As we continue to get more work from other classes as the semester intensifies, we will have to remain dedicated to the project to not let our effort slip. I think if we continue to motivate each other and plan clearly and early, we will steer away from many potential issues we would otherwise face.
