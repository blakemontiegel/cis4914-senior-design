Week 5
Name: Frank Malatesta | Group: Trainers
Time Dedicated to the Project
The following is an estimate of the amount of time I spent on each task this week:
* Work towards Presentation 1: ~3.5 hours
* Weekly group meeting: ~30 minutes
* Creating backend structure for video storage in database: ~2 hours 
Staying consistent with our weekly group meetings will keep our team committed and focused towards completing our project.
Contribution to the Project Development Process
I worked on the backend structure for allowing videos to be stored into our database. This was done through the storage of the video URL. Next will be to incorporate each piece of the project together so that the frontend requests can make changes to the database accordingly.
I also worked on Presentation 1, specifically, outlining our group's software architecture diagram. I spent some time learning how to create an effective software architecture diagram and then creating it for our corresponding project.
Demonstration of Applied Knowledge
I used my knowledge of MongoDB to create an effective structure for our database storage of videos via backend systems.
I also applied my newfound knowledge of software architecture diagrams to create one for our project with each associated piece of software.
Reflection and Lessons Learned
I feel much better about my contributions to the project this week. In past weeks I felt like I was not contributing as much as some of my other team members, but now I feel like I’m doing my part to make this a successful project. I will continue to keep up the work so that our project can be successful.
As we continue to get more work from other classes as the semester intensifies, we will have to remain dedicated to the project to not let our effort slip. I think if we continue to motivate each other and plan clearly and early, we will steer away from many potential issues we would otherwise face.
